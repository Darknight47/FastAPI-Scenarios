## Scenario 0
You’ve been asked to build a super simple backend for a web app that lets users create digital sticky notes. Think of it like a minimalist version of Google Keep — no login, no fancy features, just a place to store and retrieve notes.

The frontend team wants to be able to:

1. Create a note
2. Get all notes
3. Get a specific note by ID
4. Delete a note

Storage: Start with in-memory storage (a Python list or dictionary). No database yet — just keep it simple.
